Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
Let's proceed with the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. We'll follow these steps:

Load the dataset.
Inspect the data.
Handle missing values.
Conduct univariate analysis.
Conduct bivariate and multivariate analysis.
Identify patterns and trends.
Step 1: Load the Dataset
First, we need to load the dataset. I'll assume the dataset is named task 2.csv.
Step 2: Inspect the Data
We'll inspect the data to understand its structure and identify missing values.
Step 3: Handle Missing Values
We will handle missing values appropriately.
Step 4: Univariate Analysis
We'll analyze the distribution of individual variables.
Step 5: Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
We'll analyze relationships between pairs of variables and more complex interactions
Step 6: Identify Patterns and Trends
We'll convert categorical variables to numeric for a correlation matrix and visualize it.
Summary of Findings
Based on the above analysis, you can identify patterns and trends such as:

The survival rate by gender, class, and embarkation port.
The impact of age and fare on survival.
Correlations between different numeric variables.
